# For Loop

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use a for loop in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that takes input from the user and prints all the numbers before it, down to zero. 

-For example, if the user enters 5, the program will output:
```
Enter a number: 5
Counting down from 5 to 0:
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /* Add your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
